The general public, however, strongly belief that there are still disparities that exist, especially between the elite schools and neighborhood school, between students from families with higher socioeconomic status and those with relatively lower socioeconomic status and immigration and non-immigration families."

    "text": "4.5 Schools vs ESCS\nFinally, we take a look at schools against ESCS.\nIn the heatmap below, we easily observe that better performing schools are dominated by students belonging to higher ESCS brackets, and poorer performing schools by students in lower ESCS brackets. This suggests a strong correlation between the two factors which undermines any causation between grades, schools, and socioeconomic status as we are unable to accurately conclude if it is the school, or the ESCS that had more impact on the students’ grades.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Create 2d bin plot for ESCS ranks and School ranks\ng51 &lt;- ggplot(na.omit(df), aes(x=escs_rank, y=sch_rank)) +\n  geom_bin_2d() + \n  scale_fill_continuous(low = \"lightcyan\", high = \"lightcoral\") +\n  xlab(\"ESCS Percentile Groups\") +\n  ylab(\"School Percentile Groups\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels=c(\n    \"1\" = \"1 - 10\",\n    \"2\" = \"11 - 20\",\n    \"3\" = \"21 - 30\",\n    \"4\" = \"31 - 40\",\n    \"5\" = \"41 - 50\",\n    \"6\" = \"51 - 60\",\n    \"7\" = \"61 - 70\",\n    \"8\" = \"71 - 80\",\n    \"9\" = \"81 - 90\",\n    \"10\" = \"91 - 100\"\n  )) +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels=c(\n    \"1\" = \"1 - 10\",\n    \"2\" = \"11 - 20\",\n    \"3\" = \"21 - 30\",\n    \"4\" = \"31 - 40\",\n    \"5\" = \"41 - 50\",\n    \"6\" = \"51 - 60\",\n    \"7\" = \"61 - 70\",\n    \"8\" = \"71 - 80\",\n    \"9\" = \"81 - 90\",\n    \"10\" = \"91 - 100\"\n  )) + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Schools by ESCS\",\n    subtitle = \"Count of Students by School and ESCS Rankings\"\n  )\n\n# Plot with theme\ng51 & theme_tufte()"
